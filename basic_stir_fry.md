Basic Stir Fry
==============

A standard and simple recipe for a chicken stir fry.

Ingredients
-----------

* Rice noodles
* chicken, 200gr, thinly sliced
* one broccoli, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves
* 2 eggs
* Soy sauce
* Salt and pepper
* Olive oil
* Lime

How to
------

1. Pour hot water on the noodles, soak them for 15 minutes.

2. Heat a wok, add oil. When the oil starts smoking (really hot), fry the chicken. Season
   with salt and pepper.

3. After a few minutes, when the chicken starts to brown, add garlic. When chicken is
   almost cooked, add broccoli. Keep the stove on high heat, cook a couple minutes, then
   finish with the soy sauce (not too much, just enough to give a nice color).

4. Put aside the chicken/broccoli on a plate, clean the wok, brisk the eggs. Heat the wok again
   add some oil, and cook the eggs by spreading it all around the wok. Quickly add the noodles, mix.
   Finally add the chicken and broccoli, mix more and finish cooking for one minute.

5. Serve with a lime to squeeze on top and sesame seeds.

This recipe is very simple with a simple 1-1-1 mix of noodles, protein
(chicken), and vegetable (broccoli). You can substitute with other protein or
vegetables.
