# Margarita

## Ingrédients

Quantities are rounded slighly down for ml, but with consistent proportion and
easier to measure.

* 2 ounces (60ml) tequila (100% blue agave) 
* 3/4 ounce (20ml) of cointreau
* 3/4 ounce (20ml) fresh squeezed lime juice
* 1/4-2/4 ounce of agave nectar, adjust if you want more/less sweeteness
* salt (for the glass rim)
* large ice cubes (for shaking and serving)

## Marche à suivre

1. Pour tequila, cointreau, lime juice, and agave nectar in a cocktail shaker.
2. Get a glass out of the freezer, wait a bit, then dip the rim of the glass
   into the salt, it will stick. If you don't have a chilled glass, you can
   also use one of the squeezed lime to prepare the rim.
3. Add some ice and shake. 
4. Serve into a glass (fancy coupe or just old fashionned glass work), with
   some large cube ice (for slow dillution).

## Remarque

Skip the lime wheel/wedge garnish, it invites people to squeeze it into, and in
theory the balance is already perfect (otherwise, change it!).
