# Old Fashioned

## Ingrédients

* 2 ounces (60ml) rye whiskey
* 2 dashes Angostura bitter
* 2 dashes orange bitter
* 1 sugar cube or bar spoon of simple syrup

## Marche à suivre

1. Place the sugar cube in a glass and add the dashes of Angostura bitter and
   (optionally) orange bitter.

2. Crush the sugar with a wooden muddler.

3. Add a large ice cube. Pour the whiskey. Stir.

4. Garnish with an orange twist.

## Remarques

Old fashioned is served on-the-rocks, so either stir in another glass with many
ice cubes, or directlry stir in the serving glass with a large ice cube.  You
can use the simple syrup instead of muddling the sugar cube, if so just mix all
the ingredients and stir.
