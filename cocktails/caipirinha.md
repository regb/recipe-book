# Caipirinha

## Ingredients

* 2 ounce (60ml) Cachaca
* 2 (large) tea spoon of sugar
* 4 pieces of a lime cut in 8.

## How To

1. Remove the end pieces of the lime, then slice in half then in 4, put 4
   pieces in a shaker, add the sugar on top. Muddle to disolve the sugar with
   the lime.
2. Add Cachaca and ice. Give it a good shake.
3. Put the entire mix into an old fashioned glass.

## Remarks

Some like to build it in the glass with crushed ice and just a stir. BUt this
contains citrus so shaking should give a better integration of the ingredients.

It is transfered to the glass without straining, because you want to keep the limes. You also want dillution from the ice, and the ice from the shaker will
dillute faster.
