# Caipiroska

## Ingredients

* 2 ounce (60ml) Vodka
* 2 (large) tea spoon of sugar
* 4 pieces of a lime cut in 8.

## How To

1. Remove the end pieces of the lime, then slice in half then in 4, put 4
   pieces in a shaker, add the sugar on top. Muddle to disolve the sugar with
   the lime.
2. Add Vodka and ice. Give it a good shake.
3. Put the entire mix into an old fashioned glass.

## Remarks

Some like to build it in the glass with just a stir. BUt this contains citrus
so shaking should give a better integration of the ingredients.

It is transfered to the glass without straining, because you want the ice and
especially the lime. You can start with larger ice cubes for shaking, and they
will get smaller when poured, almost like crushed ice.
