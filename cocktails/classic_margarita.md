# Classic Margarita

## Ingredients

* 2 ounces (60ml) tequila (100% blue agave) 
* 1 oz (30ml) of orange liqueur
* 1 oz (30ml) freshly squeezed lime juice
* (Optional) 1/4-1/2 ounce (7ml-15ml) of agave nectar, adjust if you want
  more/less sweeteness
* salt (for the glass rim)

## How To

1. Pour tequila, orange liqueur, lime juice, and agave nectar in a cocktail shaker.
2. Prepare the glass with a half salt rim.
3. Add some ice and shake. 
4. Two acceptable options for serving:
   * Into a margarita ice, straight up (no ice).
   * In an old-fashioned glass, on the rocks.

## Reg's Favourite

* 2 ounces (60ml) tequila
* 3/4 ounce (20ml) cointreau
* 1 oz (30ml) lime juice
* 1/2 ounce (15ml) of agave nectar
* salt on the rim
* straight up in cocktail glass

## Remarks

Skip the lime wheel/wedge garnish, it invites people to squeeze it into, and in
theory the balance is already perfect (otherwise, change it!).
