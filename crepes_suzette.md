A classic French dessert.

* 150 ml orange juice without pulp
* 70 gr. of unsalted butter

* 2 teaspoons of orange zest
* half lemon
* 4 Tblsp. Cognac

How to
------

2. Leave the sugar to melt slowly (few minutes) until it starts to (lightly) caramel.
3. Add the butter and blend with sugar (use a fork).
4. Add a squeeze of lemon juice then mix well.
5. Add the orange zest, followed by the orange juice. raise to medium heat and leave to reduce for a couple minutes.
6. After it reduced a bit, add the grand marnier and leave it to reduce more.
6. Coat and fold each crepe in that juice one by one.
7. Once all the crepes are coated, lay them in the pan without overlap, raise heat to high and pour cognac over the crepes.
8. Catch the flame (from the stove or with a match) to flambe the crepes.
9. Once the flambe is taking place shake the pan gently to further coat the crepes with the juices.
10. When the flames goes out, serve.

Remarks
-------

The original recipe suggested to do it in two batches (3 and 3), so to use only
half the ingredient. It works well by doing all in once, but maybe there are
good reasons to do it in two batches (maybe if there's too much, the first few
crepes will absorb too much coating?).

This recipe is apparently for Crepe flambee, and crepes suzette is made
slightly differently.
