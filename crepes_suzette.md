5. Add a squeeze of lemon juice then mix well.
6. Add the orange zest, followed by the orange juice. raise to medium heat and leave to reduce for a couple minutes.

9. Catch the flame (from the stove or with a match) to flambe the crepes.
10. Once the flambe is taking place shake the pan gently to further coat the crepes with the juices.
12. When the flames stop, prepare the plates with 1-3 crepes, sprinkle some sugar on it and then cover with the remaining liquid in the pan.
13. Serve.

Remarks
-------

The original recipe suggested to do it in two batches (3 and 3), so to use only
half the ingredient. It works well by doing all in once, but maybe there are
good reasons to do it in two batches (maybe if there's too much, the first few
crepes will absorb too much coating?).

This recipe is apparently for Crepe flambee, and crepes suzette is made
slightly differently.
